<p>
The main idea is that AgerMenu should be used whenever, whereever and by whoever 
wanted to use it for website infrastructure. That why it is released as 
Public Domain - and under the two free and open licenses 
GNU Lesser Public License and GNU General Public License.
</p>

<p>
The two GNU licenses are not needed but is used to get recognition within 
the free and open source software movement so whoever want to use AgerMenu 
as part of their free and open source software project can use it. And all 
contributers  to AgerMenu get their name listed in the credit list - unless 
the contributer stated that the contribution is anonymous.
