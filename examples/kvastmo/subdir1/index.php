<p>
Menu 1 is an example website where AgerMenu is used.
</p>

<p>
This is properly the first submenu you see in AgerMenu 
because users normally will click on the upper link in 
a menu first unless there are one of the menu points 
wich just address what the user are looking for.
</p>

<p>
Now you can also see that 
the menu point is highlighted and the menu is folding out 
showing the
three submenus Menupoint 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.
