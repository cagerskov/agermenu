     - Removed the no comma in menu.csv bug in agermenu.func.php.

     - Included the Kvastmo theme/example.

     - Inserted comments in the HTML code like
     
         The menu is created using AgerMenu 0.03 
	   http://www.chbs.dk/proj/agermenu/
	 
         AgerMenu 0.03 part 1 (CSS's) begin
         AgerMenu 0.03 part 1 (CSS's) end
         AgerMenu 0.03 part 2 (The menu) begin
         AgerMenu 0.03 part 2 (The menu) end

       so visitors can see that and where AgerMenu has been used if
       they look at the HTML source code.

     - Splitted the Cascading Style Sheet files css/print.css and 
       css/screen.css in an AgerMenu part and a part for the normal 
       style elements. All the AgerMenu related CSS elements start 
       their name with "ager".

     - Created an agermenu directory where the AgerMenu specific 
       parts of the examples are placed.

     - Removed the file inc/agermenu.func.php.0.01 which was a left 
       over from version 0.01.

0.02 (2005-07-21)
     - Added the sytem variable sysvar_prog_date in the 
       inc/top.inc.php PHP include file to contain the value of the 
       release date of program. 
       
     - Changed the value of the sysvar_prog_version variable in the
       inc/top.inc.php PHP include file so it only contains the 
       version number and not the release date.

     - Changed the footer in the PHP include file inc/bottom.inc.php 
       so it still contains both the version and release date as 
       version information.
       
     - Added a link to the AgerMenu homesite in the bottom at the 
       menu (actually some code in the inc/top.inc.php PHP include 
       file) to promote AgerMenu when users just copy and paste to 
       get the menu to work.

     - AgerMenu is now also used at the page(s):
         - http://www.OpenDocument.dk/
